# KeProject
A collection of ontologies developed as project for the *Knowledge Engineering* course at *Politecnico di Milano*. <br>
Each subdirectory contains a README describing in more details the specific ontology we developed and how it can be used:

* [Cryptocurrency](Crypto/README.MD)
* [Covid](Covid/README.md)
* [Guardian News](GuardianNews/README.md)
* [911 emergency calls](911/README.md)
